# Router

This application calculates the cost of each route and uses Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm and produces a routing table for each router in the application. When a router is removed this will update all the routers and determine the new shortest route for the desired destination. Finally all the router and costs are automatically graphed using NetworkX library.
